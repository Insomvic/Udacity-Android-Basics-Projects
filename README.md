# Udacity - Android Basics Projects

A compilation of all my completed projects for the Android Basics Nanodegree by Google and Udacity. I am happy to say that I have completed this course as of February 23, 2018 and have acquired the certificate.

## Prerequisites

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
* [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

## About the Projects

* **Project 01** - *Chatty Cat* - A single-screen application that displays information about a fictional business. The purpose of this project was to display information in an appealing way using padding, margins, weight, etc.

* **Project 02** - *KDA Counter* - Tracks two teams kills, assists and deaths in any first-person shoot (FPS) videogame. These stats are then calculated into a kill/assist/death ratio. The purpose of this project was to add user input functionality via adding buttons, updating views with unique id’s.

* **Project 03** - *French Quiz* - An educational application where a user provides an answer and is provided with feedback, such as the correct answer and overall performance with the quiz questions. The purpose of this project was to create a full, responsive app that required planning and styling. Questions were implemented uniquely by using radio buttons, checkboxes and text fields.

* **Project 04** - *Nostalgic Melodies* - A music player application that focuses on historical and rememberable gaming melodies. The purpose of this project was to provide arrays of songs as well as information about each in a resourceful manner by using recycled views. This project also emphasized structuring an app with multiple activities that are linked together via explicit intents. Music does not actually play on this app yet but can be added easily.

* **Project 05** - *A Tour of Clermont-Ferrand* - A tour guide application that focuses on the city of Clermont-Ferrand, France. The purpose of this project was to present information about this city (attractions, restaurants, parks and events) in a cohesive application using fragments, and a tab layout. Each piece of information can be interacted with and presented with audio using text-to-speech.

* **Project 06** - *Nintendo News* - A news application that presents news related to Nintendo. The purpose of this project was to use an API to gather the news by sending HTTP requests and parse the JSON from the request in a background thread. While the background thread gathers the data, the foreground thread presents information to let the user understand it’s fetching data. The user is also given options on how to present the list of news (oldest, newest, number of articles displayed). When a user decides to click on an article of interest, an implicit intent is made to open the article on an installed browser. This application is essentially the foundation of networking in an application.

* **Project 07** - *Product Inventory* - A data storage application where a user can freely input, edit and delete a database of products in inventory. The purpose of this project was to implement a SQL database using tables, a contract, database helper class, cursor and content provider. “Dummy Data” can be added to easily to test for bugs in the application. A user can easily input a new product in inventory and must make sure all fields are filled out before it can be inputted into the database. If a sale is made for any item, the user can touch the “sale” button and the application will tell you how much you earned and reduce the quantity accordingly.
