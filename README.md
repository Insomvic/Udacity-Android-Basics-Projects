## About the Projects

* **Project 01** - *Chatty Cat* - A single-screen application that displays information about a fictional business. The purpose of this project was to display information in an appealing way using padding, margins, weight, etc.

* **Project 02** - *KDA Counter* - Tracks two teams kills, assists and deaths in any first-person shoot (FPS) videogame. These stats are then calculated into a kill/assist/death ratio. The purpose of this project was to add user input functionality via adding buttons, updating views with unique idâ€™s.

* **Project 03** - *French Quiz* - An educational application where a user provides an answer and is provided with feedback, such as the correct answer and overall performance with the quiz questions. The purpose of this project was to create a full, responsive app that required planning and styling. Questions were implemented uniquely by using radio buttons, checkboxes and text fields.

* **Project 04** - *Nostalgic Melodies* - A music player application that focuses on historical and rememberable gaming melodies. The purpose of this project was to provide arrays of songs as well as information about each in a resourceful manner by using recycled views. This project also emphasized structuring an app with multiple activities that are linked together via explicit intents. Music does not actually play on this app yet but can be added easily.
